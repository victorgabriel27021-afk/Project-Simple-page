  	<p><strong>"I represent a place where, from a young age, we understand the value of peace, justice, freedom, equality, and unity. We value what we wear and what we achieve, where a thousand-dollar pair of sneakers is worth much more than a thousand reais; it's worth a life, for those who have them or for those who want to have them. We add value to that."</strong></p>
